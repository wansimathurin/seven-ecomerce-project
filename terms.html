        <h1>LICENSE AND ACCESS</h1>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Conditions of Use and any Service Terms, and your payment of any
            applicable fees, Amazon or its content providers grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
            non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Amazon Services. This
            license does not include any resale or commercial use of any Amazon Service, or its contents; any collection
            and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of any Amazon Service or its
            contents; any downloading, copying, or other use of account information for the benefit of any third party;
            or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. All rights not expressly
            granted to you in these Conditions of Use or any Service Terms are reserved and retained by Amazon or its
            licensors, suppliers, publishers, rightsholders, or other content providers. No Amazon Service, nor any part
            of any Amazon Service, may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited
            for any commercial purpose without express written consent of Amazon. You may not frame or utilize framing
            techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page
            layout, or form) of Amazon without express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other
            "hidden text" utilizing Amazon's name or trademarks without the express written consent of Amazon. You may
            not misuse the Amazon Services. You may use the Amazon Services only as permitted by law. The licenses
            granted by Amazon terminate if you do not comply with these Conditions of Use or any Service Terms.</p>

        <h1>YOUR ACCOUNT</h1>
        <p>You may need your own Amazon account to use certain Amazon Services, and you may be required to be logged in
            to the account and have a valid payment method associated with it. If there is a problem charging your
            selected payment method, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your account. Visit
            Your Payments to manage your payment options. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
            your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility
            for all activities that occur under your account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but it
            sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are
            under 18, you may use the Amazon Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Parents and
            guardians may create profiles for teenagers in their Amazon Household. Alcohol listings on Amazon are
            intended for adults. You must be at least 21 years of age to purchase alcohol, or use any site functionality
            related to alcohol. Amazon reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, terminate your rights
            to use Amazon Services, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion.</p>

        <h1>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND <br>OTHER CONTENT</h1>
        <p>You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and
            submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal,
            obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including
            publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or
            contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or
            any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address,
            impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. Amazon
            reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review
            posted content.
            If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Amazon a
            nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify,
            adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content
            throughout the world in any media. You grant Amazon and sublicensees the right to use the name that you
            submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise
            control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the
            content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that
            you will indemnify Amazon for all claims resulting from content you supply. Amazon has the right but not the
            obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. Amazon takes no responsibility and assumes
            no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.</p>
